# Salad

## Recipe

1. Mix a neutral oil, vinegar (I use aceto balsamico) and mustard in a salad bowl. Depending on your taste and how salty and sweet the mustard is, you may also want to add some salt and/or sugar, and you could add things like garlic, herbs and spices. Most of the time I just go with oil, vinegar and mustard.
2. Add a packaged, pre-washed salad mix. If you have a spoon or two left, you can get cheaper salad that you need to prepare and wash yourself, or even grow your own salad. If you want a side salad, mix, and you are done. If you want something more filling, go to step 3.
3. Add kidney beans or tuna for protein (there are, of course, several other options, but these are the two I have most frequently), sweet corn and anything else you might like (tomatoes are nice, but require some preparation).
4. Mix well.
5. If you live alone, eat right from the salad bowl.

## Tips

- Use olive oil and add freshly ground black pepper. Dijon mustard is a good one if you're unsure.
- If you have fresh courgettes they can be added raw.
