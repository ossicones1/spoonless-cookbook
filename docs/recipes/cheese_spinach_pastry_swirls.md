# Cheese and spinach pastry swirls

## Recipe

1. Unroll a 325g sheet of ready-made puff pastry with the long side facing you.
2. Spread 1 tablespoon of marmite (or pesto?) over the puff pastry, then tear two handfuls of fresh spinach and scatter 80g of grated cheese on the pastry.
3. Roll the pastry up, away from you, to make a long sausage shape. Cut it into 12 pieces.
4. Put the pieces spiral-side up onto parchment-lined baking trays and squish them down a bit with your hands. (You can freeze them now if you want to!)
5. Bake them for 15-20 minutes (or 25 minutes from frozen) in an oven preheated to 200°C/180°C fan/gas mark 6.

## Tips

- They are good hot or cold, would be nice with soup or can be eaten on their own, and can be cooked from frozen if you want to make them in advance and freeze them.
