# Roast potatoes and baked beans

## Recipe

1. Cut some potatoes into chunks and roast them in oil on a baking tray until cooked through, 40 to 60 minutes depends on size of bits.
2. When potato cooked pour a can of baked beans over the top
3. Pour some grated cheese on top of this
4. Bake until starting to brown on top, the tomato sauce from beans should be thick and be going brownish, not red like when you first pour it out of the can.

## Tips

- Nice with salad, but can eat on its own. Nice with some salt.
- You can add quorn mince, cut up sausage, etc if wanting more protein. If you do this (put sausages, mince, etc in) put in in for required time with the beans, eg 25 mins, then add cheese 10 minutes before end so cheese does not burn.
