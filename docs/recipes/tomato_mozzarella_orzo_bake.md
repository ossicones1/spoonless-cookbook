# Tomato & Mozzarella Orzo Bake

Serves 2

## Recipe

1. put 200g of orzo pasta in a large, shallow baking dish (we use a pyrex one)
2. empty a tin of chopped tomatoes into the baking dish, then fill the tin 3/4 full with cold water and add the water to the dish too
3. add 1 teaspoon of dried herbs, some frozen garlic, some frozen peppers, a handful of halved olives and some chilli powder, then stir
4. bake in the oven for around 25 minutes at 180Â°C, stirring once or twice during cooking
5. when the orzo is just cooked (taste it to check!), slice a ball of mozzarella and put the slices on top of the pasta bake. Return it to the oven for 5-10 minutes to melt the cheese, then serve

## Tips

If you feel up to adding more ingredients in step 3, sliced roasted red peppers (from a jar), frozen spinach and/or frozen peas are nice too. A drained tin of butter beans, mixed in when you add the mozzarella, might be nice too, and would add extra protein.
