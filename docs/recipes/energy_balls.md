# Energy balls (or bars)

Colitis and IBS/IBD friendly(?).

Food-processor needed.

## Ingredients

- 6 to 10 dates
- Handful of walnuts or cashews unsalted
- Half teaspoon cocoa powder

## Recipe

1. Blitz nuts until 1mm size pieces.
2. Then add dates and blitz together.
3. Then add cocoa.
4. If you can press together and it sticks it's ready.
5. You can make ball or bar shapes or no shapes or press into a tin and cut bits off.
6. It lasts ages. Best in fridge.

## Tips

- You can add flavours or other dried fruit. Or replace dates with date syrup. If you need calories or huge energy or prefer chocolate texture add coconut oil or cocoa butter or other hard fat.
- if you add a drop of orange essence they taste like chocolate orange fudge! (Alternatively use vanilla, coffee, or peppermint.)
