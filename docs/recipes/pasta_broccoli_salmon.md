- "I just used up half a courgette, half an onion and half a glass of tomato pur√©e and some herb cream cheese I had left from the last time I made pasta. This time I used couscous instead of pasta, but as they are both made of wheat, technically, the ingredients were the same. I like the texture of couscous, and it's even less work than pasta (less stirring, no decanting)."
