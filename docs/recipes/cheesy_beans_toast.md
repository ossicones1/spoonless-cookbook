# Cheesy beans on toast

## Recipe

1. grate cheese
2. heat beans in pan or microwave
3. put bread in toaster
4. butter toast
5. assemble buttered toast
6. add beans and grated cheese in order of your choice

## Tips

- If you don't have a grater but you do have a knife, you could slice the cheese as thinly as you can (so it still melts when you put it on the beans).
- Or, if you can afford to, you could buy a bag of ready-grated cheese (though it is a little more expensive than cheese in a block).
