# Miscellaneous cooking tips

- When cooking couscous, it works better if you put a stock cube in the boiling water.
- Frozen mashed potatoes are thing.
- Other useful frozen ingredients: onions, peppers, garlic, ginger.
- Jarred 'Very Lazy' garlic/ginger/chilli is recommended.
- There's a thing called a wonder bag which I used to cook slow cooker recipes in. If you got a hob and pan then you can heat food to hot on hob then put in wonder bag for many hours and cooks things really well and it is also very good keeping things warm for later. It uses no electric so it is used in third world countries, when you buy one a twin one is donated to someone in a third world country, I do not know if third world is the correct word anymore.
- "Instant pots are better than slow cookers. More versatile." - "The instant pot has a slow cooker function, but itâ€™s an electric pressure cooker." - "With an instant pot you can make soups and things in the usual time, beans and pulses that you have to boil or soak in a fraction of the time, and slow cooker recipes as normal.I have inserts for mine so I can make separate foods at the same time. Our favourite is pesto ranch chicken, but the ranch dressing mix would not be worth it for a British person. It's worth it to me because I like it and miss it."
