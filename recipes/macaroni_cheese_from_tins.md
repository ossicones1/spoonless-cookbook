# Macaroni cheese bake from tins

## Recipe

1. Empty four tins of macaroni cheese, 1 tin of mixed veg and 1 tin of green beans (both drained) into a baking dish
2. Sprinkle on grated cheese
3. Put in the oven at 180 for half an hour :)

## Tips

- if you get a tub of breadcrumbs, then sprinkling the breadcrumbs on top of the cheese before baking makes a lovely crunch topping.
