**Simplest version**

1. Fry a package (1 lb or 400g) of ground beef in a frying pan until it is fully cooked. 
2. Add salt & pepper 
3. Prepare whatever carbohydrate is quickest and easiest to you. (The traditional component is a 400g package of elbow macaroni, but some simpler ideas are instant microwaveable rice, or ramen noodles, or pita bread, or couscous, or anything else that is easy.)

**Version with onions (my fave)**

2. Saut√© chopped onion in oil in frying pan.
