# More ideas for low-spoon meals

## Pasta with sauce

- Pasta with sauce from a jar.
- Alternatively: Make the sauce from tomato pur√©e, water and spices (usually using a pasta mix and sometimes adding something else like pepper or a bit of cinnamon). I sometimes add lentils for protein. I also like to add courgette (cut into pieces or put in a blender - if cut in pieces, it can be cooked together with the pasta), and onion if I have an onion and the spoons to do the cutting and frying. If the courgettes are fresh they can be added raw.

## Simple vegan stew

- If you like spicy/Iranian style flavours, a simple vegan stew can be made with a good quality ras-el-hanout spice mix (very fragrant with the odd rose petal) frozen casserole pack and mushroom stock. It's nice served with quinoa.

## Easy nachos

- Beetroot, cream cheese, nachos. Cheap, quick, gorgeous.

## Bolognese sauce and pancakes

- If you have leftover bolognaise sauce have it on pancakes with cheese on top.
- Extra pancakes can be frozen with sheets of just about anything (cling film, parchment, silicone, etc.) between them. They reheat in the microwave between two plates.
